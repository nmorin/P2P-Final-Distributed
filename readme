README for P2P File Sharing System

Distributed Systems, Spring 2015

We have two main classes in our system:

	Tracker.java ->	Our Tracker is the main node in the system. It keeps track of who has
					which pieces of a certain file, and can return the file list to any 
					Peer who asks for it. The Tracker can handle 'seed' requests from 
					Peers, which adds a file to the hash map of file systems, and handles
					'query' requests, when a Peer is asking for who has a certain file.
					There is a single tracker in our system, with a hardcoded IP address.

	Peer.java ->	All nodes but our Tracker are Peers. They can seed files to the Tracker
					so that other Peers may download the file, request to download a given
					file from another Peer, ask the Tracker for who has a certain file,
					and can handle the requests from other Peers. The tracker IP address is
					hardcoded into this file.

To compile our code, use 'make'.

Running the code:

	Tracker ->

		java -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=52.7.147.25 Tracker

		The IP address of our Tracker is hardcoded into the code. We have one tracker
		that every party must use. Therefore, the only way to run the Tracker is as
		stated above, from the machine with the public IP: '52.7.147.25'. This is a
		machine from Amazon in Virgina, USA.

	Peer ->

		java -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=<IP Address> Peer <IP Address> <Port Number> <Name>

			This, unlike the Tracker, has much more variable commandline arguments: 

		<IP Address>		Your IP Address (notice you type it twice)
		<Port Number>		The port number you are binding yourself to, where other Peers can find you
		<Name>				Choose a name for yourself: How you will be known as on the system


Command Line as a Peer:

	Peers have a number of options, specified through the command line once the program is running.

		request <fileName>

			Will request and download the file from Peers currently in the system

		seed <fileName>

			Tells the tracker that you have the file, which allows others on the system to
			download it from you

		exit

			Exits the system!

	Any other syntax is not processed. Any fileName that is not valid is not processed.
